    <p> My name is Kwo Sien Njo, for short Kwo. I'm working as a market researcher in Fremont area. I decided to join this course,
        because it looks like everything is related to internet nowadays. <br> I hope joining this course would be a good investment
    to my carrier in the long run. In my leasure time, I very much enjoy reading and finding out cool things about cars. <br>
    My interest in cars is not limited to supercars like most people I also enjoy reading articles about ordinary cars and get
    to know them. <br>I guess, since I started this course I would need to switch my interest to coding full time. So far,
    I'm learning a lot in this class almost to the point of overwhelming. I understand that this is bootcamp, and not a conventional
    type of learning. I just need to take a deep breath and remind my self, everything is going to be alright. In closing, 
    I sure hope to master some of the important programing language from this class. Which I can use to advance my carrier.
    I would like use my current experience and the new knowledge I retained from this class and create a synergy. 
    Thank you, and I hope everybody will do EXCELLENT in this class.</p>
